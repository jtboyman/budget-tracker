  ## Description:
  The budget tracker app is a simple app that can be used to keep track of one's budget, primarily intended for use with travel. The app template was given beforehand and I added offline capabilities utilizing IndexedDB and service workers. When internet connection drops, the app is still functional and saves changes when connection is reestablished.
